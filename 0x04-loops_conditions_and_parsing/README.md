Loops:

Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met.
Common types of loops include for loops, while loops, and do-while loops.
for loops are generally used when the number of iterations is known beforehand.
while loops are used when the condition for looping is evaluated before each iteration.
do-while loops are similar to while loops but guarantee that the block of code is executed at least once.
Conditions:

Conditions are used to make decisions in your code based on whether a certain expression or variable meets a specified criteria.
Common conditional statements include if, else if, and else.
Conditional operators like == (equal), != (not equal), < (less than), > (greater than), etc., are used to evaluate conditions.
Parsing:

Parsing refers to the process of analyzing a sequence of symbols or characters to extract meaningful information.
In the context of programming, parsing often involves converting data from one format to another or extracting relevant pieces of information from a larger dataset.
Parsing can be used in tasks like reading and interpreting data from files, handling user input, or processing data from external sources.

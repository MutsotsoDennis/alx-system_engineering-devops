Networking basics involve understanding the fundamental concepts and technologies that enable communication between computers and devices. Here are some key networking basics:

Network Definition:
A network is a collection of computers, servers, mainframes, network devices, and other devices connected to one another for sharing data and resources.

Types of Networks:

LAN (Local Area Network): Limited to a small geographic area, like a single building or campus.
WAN (Wide Area Network): Spans a larger geographic area, connecting LANs over long distances, often using public infrastructure.
MAN (Metropolitan Area Network): Covers a larger geographic area than a LAN but is smaller than a WAN, typically within a city.
Network Topologies:

Bus Topology: All devices share a single communication line.
Star Topology: All devices are connected to a central hub or switch.
Ring Topology: Devices are connected in a circular fashion.
Mesh Topology: Devices are interconnected, providing multiple paths for data transmission.
Networking Devices:

Router: Connects different networks and routes data between them.
Switch: Connects devices within the same network, forwarding data based on MAC addresses.
Hub: Basic networking device that connects multiple devices in a LAN.
Bridge: Connects and filters traffic between two network segments.
IP Addressing:

Devices on a network are assigned IP addresses for identification and communication.
IP addresses can be IPv4 (e.g., 192.168.1.1) or IPv6 (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).
Subnetting:

Dividing an IP network into sub-networks for better organization and efficient use of IP addresses.
Protocols:

TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol): Fundamental suite of protocols governing the Internet.
HTTP/HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol/Secure): Used for web browsing.
FTP (File Transfer Protocol): Used for file transfer.
DNS (Domain Name System):

Translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses.
Firewalls:

Security devices that control incoming and outgoing network traffic.
Wireless Networking:

Wi-Fi enables devices to connect wirelessly to a network.
Network Security:

Involves measures to protect data and network infrastructure from unauthorized access and attacks.
Cloud Computing:

Involves accessing and using computing resources (e.g., storage, processing power) over the Internet.
Understanding these networking basics provides a foundation for delving into more advanced networking concepts and technologies.
